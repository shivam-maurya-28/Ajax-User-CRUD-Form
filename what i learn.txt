what i have learned from this project 

we can use data-anyname="+var[i].id+"  to assign the attribute id of row. for more operation of that row.

we can use ajax with get method to fetch data 
	like we can write this ajax in function and call everytime when a button is click so that data update or refresh data without page load.

get the form specific classname element attribute value in variable .

when i am deleting the row and updating the table  it's long process to save time i used the
before ajax started. 
mythis = this;
$(mythis).closest('tr').fadeOut();
hide that row from screen.

Jquery function i used
ready()
attr()
on()
val()
ajax()
html()
reset()  ex. $("#myform")[0].reset();
closest() fadeout() ex. $(mythis).closest('tr').fadeOut();

Edit button working
-> get the row button data-delete id  into variable 
-> then passed to the edit.php to fetch that id detail and set to the form element using jquery and val($valueToSet) 
->make a filed of input text and set the value of that row id.
-> make changes in the insert jquery code that get the id and passed to the sql query with if dublicate key then update  else new row.
