what i have learned from this project 

we can use data-anyname="+var[i].id+"  to assign the attribute id of row. for more operation of that row.

we can use ajax with get method to fetch data 
	like we can write this ajax in function and call everytime when a button is click so that data update or refresh data without page load.

get the form specific classname element attribute value in variable .

when i am deleting the row and updating the table  it's long process to save time i used the
before ajax started. 
mythis = this;
$(mythis).closest('tr').fadeOut();
hide that row from screen.

own if id exist the update query block run else insert block run
